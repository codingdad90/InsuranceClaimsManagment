//Progress//
  Fixed errors related to database issues.
  Began work on unique view for Adjustor.
  
//Issues//
  It would be helpful for me to have more active feedback from the team on discord. Kirk has been very active, but Maurice is kind of hard to communicate with sometimes.
  I have a reference object bug I'm having trouble fixing in attempting to get data to display on the page.
  
//Goals//
  Complete and bug test unique view for Adjustor. (Next week)
