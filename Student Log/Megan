Progress: I met with my group and we were able to make a plan for our project. We discussed everyone’s role and we were able to schedule a meeting to discuss our project further. 
In our meeting we had a speaker discuss Insurance, so we are able to understand the project more. 

Issues: I haven’t come across any issues yet. Everyone in the group agreed on a meeting time and date to further discuss the project.

Goals: We mentioned our goals in the first meeting and I’m sure we will have more clear goals after some more meetings.
My personal goal is to start thinking about design and work on some mockups.

1/29/21: Sprint 1
The team is working really well together. We have had multiple team meetings to talk about what we need from everyone and to vote on company names, as well as any questions we had.

The team has made a lot of progress since the first class. The programmers have been working on the software while Afrah and I work on our individual tasks. We have decided on a logo, a business name and 
a product name so far. 

We have some team goals but mostly individual. Our team goal is to finish our tasks and ask questions or ask for help if we need it. The team has communicated through Discord via the chat boxes
as well as the voice calls.
